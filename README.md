# Space Invaders

A simple Tetris game made in Javascript based on the tutorial by Ania Kubow @kubowania. It has been a while since I did something fun, so went back to her page and found this.

- Here's the link to the tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nz4Yp7Y_uA)
- I added some music and art to it.
- Art (and some audio fx) taken from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-art) 


## TODO
- [ ] Add touchscreen support
- [ ] Will think about levels and stuff later, hopefully.
- [ ] Add powerups and/or life
